    "# 📈 The Black-Scholes-Merton Model: A Breakthrough in Options Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we explore one of the most significant achievements in the field of financial derivatives—the **Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model**. This model provides a closed-form solution for pricing European options, laying the foundation for modern options theory and influencing the development of many financial models. In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the key assumptions and derivation of the BSM model.\n",
    "- Explore the **Black-Scholes equation**, a partial differential equation at the heart of the model.\n",
    "- Introduce the concept of the **risk-neutral world**, crucial for pricing derivatives.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how the BSM formula can be applied to calculate option prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BSM model revolutionized options pricing by eliminating the need for subjective risk preferences and providing a replicable method for pricing options under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚖️ Assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The BSM model relies on a set of simplifying assumptions that allow for an elegant mathematical solution. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Arbitrage**: The model assumes that arbitrage opportunities do not exist in the market.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Markets**: All market participants have equal access to information, and prices reflect all known information.\n",
    "3. **Constant Risk-Free Rate**: The risk-free rate remains constant over the option's life.\n",
    "4. **Log-Normal Stock Price Distribution**: The stock prices follow a **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, implying they exhibit a continuous log-normal distribution.\n",
    "5. **No Dividends**: The underlying asset does not pay any dividends during the option's life.\n",
    "6. **Constant Volatility**: The volatility of the stock price is assumed to be constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these assumptions simplify the mathematical framework, they also highlight the model's limitations in real-world applications. Nonetheless, it serves as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of option pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 The Black-Scholes Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model is built upon the **Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE)**, which governs the price of the option as a function of time and the price of the underlying asset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} = r V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $V$ is the value of the option.\n",
    "- $S$ is the price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the asset price.\n",
    "- $t$ is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this equation under the right boundary conditions leads to the famous **Black-Scholes pricing formulas** for European call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ The Risk-Neutral World\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical concept introduced by the BSM model is that of the **risk-neutral world**. In this framework, all investors are indifferent to risk, meaning that they require no extra return for taking on additional risk. The implication is that the expected return on the underlying asset is equal to the risk-free rate when valuing options, rather than the asset's actual expected return. This simplifies the pricing of derivatives by focusing on replication and arbitrage-free pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Black-Scholes Pricing Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The closed-form solutions for the prices of European call and put options under the BSM model are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Option:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C = S_0 N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put Option:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $C$ is the price of the call option.\n",
    "- $P$ is the price of the put option.\n",
    "- $S_0$ is the current stock price.\n",
    "- $X$ is the strike price.\n",
    "- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate.\n",
    "- $T$ is the time to maturity.\n",
    "- $N(d)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "- $d_1$ and $d_2$ are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0 / X) + (r + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Applications in Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Option Pricing**: The BSM model provides a straightforward method for pricing European call and put options.\n",
    "2. **Risk Management**: The model aids in determining **option Greeks**, such as delta, gamma, and theta, which are used to hedge option positions and manage risk.\n",
    "3. **Volatility Estimation**: Implied volatility, derived from the BSM model, plays a key role in market analysis and trading strategies."
