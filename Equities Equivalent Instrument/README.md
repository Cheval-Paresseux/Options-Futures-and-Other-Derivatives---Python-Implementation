# Equities Equivalent Instruments - Python Implementation

This branch focuses on the implementation of equities equivalent instruments, following the structure from John Hull's *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*. It covers core topics like financial time series simulation, option pricing, and options strategies.

## Structure

The content is organized by chapters related to equities equivalent instruments from Hull’s book, specifically Chapters 10 to 15. Each chapter has its own Jupyter notebook, which includes:

- A recap of key concepts.
- Python implementations of the models.
- Worked-out examples to demonstrate the practical applications.
- Exercises and problems solved using Python.

You can also find a `.py` file that gathers some useful functions.

### Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 10: Options Markets**  
  Introduction to options markets, including definitions of call and put options, option trading mechanics, and a discussion of option exchanges.

- **Chapter 11: Properties of Stock Options**  
  Examines the intrinsic properties of stock options, such as upper and lower bounds, factors influencing option prices, and the put-call parity relationship.

- **Chapter 12: Strategies Using Options**  
  Practical strategies utilizing options, including covered calls, protective puts, spreads, and combinations. Python implementations for strategy performance analysis.

- **Chapter 13: Binomial Trees**  
  Detailed overview of the binomial tree model for pricing options, with Python implementations for various option types (e.g., American, European).

- **Chapter 14: Wiener Processes and Ito's Lemma**  
  Introduction to stochastic processes in finance, focusing on the Wiener process and Ito’s Lemma as foundational concepts for modeling stock price movements.

- **Chapter 15: The Black-Scholes-Merton Model**  
  Comprehensive breakdown of the Black-Scholes-Merton model, including derivation, assumptions, and Python implementations for calculating option prices under different market conditions.
