# Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives - Python Implementation

This repository provides a Python implementation of key concepts and models from John Hull's *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*. It covers essential topics such as option pricing, stochastic processes, and risk management, offering a hands-on approach to understanding these financial instruments through practical examples and exercises.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, following an exhaustive list from Hull's book *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*. Each chapter has its own Jupyter notebook that summarizes the core concepts and provides illustrative examples. In addition, exercises and problems from the book are solved and explained in detail.
