    "# 🔄 Swaps: Interest Rate and Currency Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of **swaps**, as presented in Chapter 7 of John Hull's *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*. We will cover the key concepts, pricing mechanisms, and applications of **interest rate swaps** and **currency swaps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏦 Interest Rate Swaps\n",
    "An **interest rate swap** involves exchanging cash flows between two parties, typically swapping fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments or vice versa. The most common type is the **plain vanilla interest rate swap**, where one party pays a fixed rate while the other pays a floating rate based on a reference rate like LIBOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general cash flow structure of an interest rate swap is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed payment leg**: The party making fixed payments will pay a fixed interest rate, calculated on a notional principal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Floating payment leg**: The party making floating payments will pay interest based on a reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) adjusted periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Fixed and Floating Cash Flows\n",
    "- **Fixed Cash Flow**:\n",
    "  $$ \n",
    "  \\text{Fixed Cash Flow} = \\text{Notional Principal} \\times \\frac{\\text{Fixed Rate}}{\\text{Payment Frequency}} \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floating Cash Flow**:\n",
    "  $$ \n",
    "  \\text{Floating Cash Flow} = \\text{Notional Principal} \\times \\frac{\\text{Floating Rate}}{\\text{Payment Frequency}} \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💱 Currency Swaps\n",
    "In a **currency swap**, two parties exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies. The typical structure involves one party paying interest in one currency, while the other party pays interest in a different currency. At the swap's initiation, the principal amounts are exchanged, and at maturity, they are swapped back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Valuing a Currency Swap\n",
    "The value of a currency swap is determined by the present value of future cash flows in each currency. The steps include:\n",
    "1. **Discounting the foreign currency cash flows** at the foreign interest rate.\n",
    "2. **Converting** the foreign currency present value into the domestic currency using the current exchange rate.\n",
    "3. **Discounting the domestic cash flows** at the domestic interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net value of the swap is the difference between the present values of the cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Applications of Swaps\n",
    "Swaps are widely used for hedging, arbitrage, and speculation in financial markets. Some common applications include:\n",
    "- **Managing interest rate exposure**: Companies use interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt (or vice versa) to manage their interest rate risk.\n",
    "- **Foreign exchange management**: Multinational corporations utilize currency swaps to hedge foreign currency cash flows and minimize foreign exchange risk.\n"
