    "# 🛡️ Hedging Strategies Using Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook explores **hedging strategies** with futures contracts, focusing on minimizing risk in portfolios. We delve into key concepts such as **basis risk** and **hedge ratios**, following John Hull's approach. Additionally, we will discuss how to calculate the optimal number of contracts, adjust the beta of a portfolio, and incorporate marking-to-market adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📉 Basis Risk\n",
    "Basis risk arises when the futures contract price does not perfectly track the spot price of the underlying asset. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Basis} = S_t - F_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $S_t$ is the spot price at time $t$\n",
    "- $F_t$ is the futures price at time $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Hedge Ratios\n",
    "The optimal hedge ratio ($h^*$) is derived from the principle of minimizing the variance of the hedged portfolio. According to John Hull, it is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h^* = \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_S}{\\sigma_F}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between the changes in the spot price and the futures price.\n",
    "- $\\sigma_S$ is the standard deviation of the changes in the spot price.\n",
    "- $\\sigma_F$ is the standard deviation of the changes in the futures price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Optimal Number of Contracts\n",
    "Once the optimal hedge ratio is determined, the next step is to calculate the optimal number of futures contracts to hedge the position. This is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N^* = h^* \\frac{QA}{QF}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N^*$ is the optimal number of futures contracts.\n",
    "- $QA$ is the size of the position being hedged.\n",
    "- $QF$ is the contract size of one futures contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Adjusting Portfolio Beta with Futures\n",
    "Futures can also be used to adjust the beta ($\\beta$) of a portfolio. If you want to change the beta of a portfolio with two assets, the number of contracts needed is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = \\frac{(\\beta_T - \\beta_P) \\cdot V_A}{\\beta_F \\cdot V_F}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N$ is the number of futures contracts.\n",
    "- $\\beta_T$ is the target beta of the portfolio.\n",
    "- $\\beta_P$ is the current beta of the portfolio.\n",
    "- $\\beta_F$ is the beta of the futures contract.\n",
    "- $V_P$ is the value of the portfolio."
