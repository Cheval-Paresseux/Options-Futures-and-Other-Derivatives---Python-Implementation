    "# 📉 Securitization, ABS, and the 2007 Financial Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook explores the process of **securitization**, focusing on **Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)** and **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)** backed by ABS, as discussed in Chapter 8 of John Hull's *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏦 What is Securitization?\n",
    "Securitization is the financial process of pooling various types of debt (like mortgages, auto loans, or credit card debt) and selling these pools as **securities** to investors. It enables financial institutions to move debt off their balance sheets and generate liquidity, but also introduces complexity and layers of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "- **Originators**: Banks or other financial institutions that originate loans (e.g., mortgages).\n",
    "- **Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)**: Entities created to pool the loans and issue securities backed by them.\n",
    "- **Tranches**: The pooled debt is split into slices called tranches, each offering different levels of risk and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)\n",
    "An **Asset-Backed Security (ABS)** is a type of securitized financial product backed by a pool of non-mortgage loans, such as auto loans, student loans, or credit card receivables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How ABS are Constructed:\n",
    "1. **Pooling**: A collection of similar types of loans (auto loans, credit card debt, etc.) is gathered by an originator (like a bank).\n",
    "2. **Securitization**: These pooled loans are sold to an SPV, which packages them into securities.\n",
    "3. **Tranching**: The ABS is divided into different tranches. Each tranche has a different risk profile:\n",
    "   - **Senior Tranches**: The safest, with first claim on cash flows from the loan repayments.\n",
    "   - **Mezzanine Tranches**: Riskier than senior tranches, but offer higher returns.\n",
    "   - **Equity Tranches**: The riskiest, receiving payments only after the higher-priority tranches are paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks in ABS:\n",
    "- **Credit risk**: The chance that borrowers default on their loans.\n",
    "- **Prepayment risk**: Borrowers may repay their loans earlier than expected, disrupting the cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏦 ABS CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation)\n",
    "A **Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** is a financial product constructed from a pool of **asset-backed securities (ABS)** or other debt instruments, typically structured into tranches based on risk. CDOs introduce an additional layer of securitization, making them even more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How ABS CDOs are Constructed:\n",
    "1. **Collecting ABS**: The SPV purchases a pool of ABS, which themselves are already backed by underlying loans like mortgages or credit card debt.\n",
    "2. **Pooling the ABS**: The ABS are bundled together to create a diversified pool of assets.\n",
    "3. **Tranching the CDO**: Similar to ABS, the CDO is divided into tranches based on risk:\n",
    "   - **Senior Tranches**: First in line for payments; lowest risk but lowest returns.\n",
    "   - **Mezzanine Tranches**: Intermediate risk and return.\n",
    "   - **Equity Tranches**: Highest risk, as they absorb losses first, but with the potential for higher returns.\n",
    "4. **Ratings**: Each tranche is given a credit rating by rating agencies based on its risk. Senior tranches often receive higher credit ratings (e.g., AAA), while equity tranches are riskier and rated lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks in ABS CDO:\n",
    "- **Systemic Risk**: Since ABS CDOs are composed of other securitized products, their risks are linked to the performance of the underlying ABS, which can result in cascading losses.\n",
    "- **Complexity and Lack of Transparency**: The multiple layers of securitization make it difficult to assess the true risk of CDOs, leading to a false sense of security prior to the crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📉 The 2007 Financial Crisis: The Role of ABS and ABS CDOs\n",
    "The 2007 crisis was driven in part by the collapse of **subprime mortgages** packaged into ABS and CDOs. As housing prices fell, mortgage defaults increased, and the complex structures of ABS and ABS CDOs began to unravel, leading to massive losses for investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crisis Timeline:\n",
    "1. **Subprime Lending Boom**: Financial institutions extended mortgages to borrowers with poor credit (subprime) and securitized them into ABS.\n",
    "2. **Demand for CDOs**: Investors’ demand for higher yields led to the creation of CDOs backed by risky subprime ABS.\n",
    "3. **Housing Market Crash**: When housing prices started to decline, subprime borrowers defaulted on their mortgages in large numbers.\n",
    "4. **Contagion**: The defaults affected not only the ABS but also the ABS CDOs, leading to severe losses throughout the financial system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Lessons Learned\n",
    "The collapse of ABS and ABS CDOs during the crisis highlighted several important lessons:\n",
    "- **Over-reliance on Ratings**: Investors heavily relied on credit ratings, which underestimated the risk of lower tranches in CDOs.\n",
    "- **Systemic Risk**: Complex financial instruments like CDOs linked many parts of the financial system, causing widespread damage when defaults increased.\n",
    "- **Regulation and Transparency**: The crisis led to the introduction of regulations like the **Dodd-Frank Act** to improve transparency and reduce excessive risk-taking.\n"
