# Fixed Income Instruments & Derivatives - Python Implementation

This branch focuses on the implementation of fixed income instruments and their associated derivatives, following the structure from John Hull's *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives*. It covers core topics like bond pricing, interest rate models, and interest rate derivatives (e.g., swaps and forwards).

## Structure

The content is organized by chapters related to fixed income instruments from Hullâ€™s book, specifically Chapters 2 to 5. Each chapter has its own Jupyter notebook, which includes:

- A recap of key concepts.
- Python implementations of the models.
- Worked-out examples to demonstrate the practical applications.
- Exercises and problems solved using Python.

You can also find a .py file that gathers some useful functions. 

### Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 2: Mechanics of Futures Markets**  
  Overview of futures contracts, with a focus on bond futures and how they work in financial markets.

- **Chapter 3: Hedging Strategies Using Futures**  
  Practical examples of how futures contracts are used to hedge fixed income positions.

- **Chapter 4: Interest Rates**  
  Introduction to interest rate mechanics, calculation of yield, duration, and convexity of bonds.

- **Chapter 5: Determination of Forward and Futures Prices**  
  Detailed look at how forward and futures prices are determined for fixed income securities, including examples using interest rate forwards and swaps.

- **Chapter 6: Interest Rates Futures**  
  Covers the pricing and application of interest rate futures, including Eurodollar and Treasury futures. Includes Python implementations for calculating future prices and exercises for practical scenarios.

- **Chapter 7: Swaps**  
  Explores swaps, including definitions, types (interest rate and currency swaps), and valuation methods. Provides Python code for swap valuation and practical exercises.

- **Chapter 8: Securitization & 2007 Crisis**  
  Focuses on securitization processes, particularly Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) and CDOs. Analyzes their role in the 2007 financial crisis with Python implementations for ABS valuation and case studies.

**(Chapters 1 & 9 are not covered here as they are related to more "informative" subjects)**

## How to Use

- Explore the notebooks in this branch to get a deeper understanding of fixed income instruments and derivatives.
- Each notebook is self-contained, providing a step-by-step guide through the relevant concepts and their Python implementations.
